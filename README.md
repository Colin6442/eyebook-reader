# EyeRead
#This is our group project for UCMerced's CSE155: Human Computer Interaction Spring 2022. Our group made an application for being able to read text using your eye as the main interaction tool.
# To Use:
#1) Download the zipped source code of this project from this page
#2) Unzip it in your local folder of choice
#3) Install Python 3.10.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ . This application will NOT run without this or later version of python. While installing, make sure to add Python to PATH OR add it after installation
#4) Open the command line
#5) Type *pip install flask* into the command line. If you get an error Python has NOT been added to your PATH correctly. Please consult a website such as https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/ or similar for help
#6) Navigate to the directory where the unzipped contents are
#7) Type *python main.py*
