# EyeRead
#This is our group project for UCMerced's CSE155: Human Computer Interaction Spring 2022. Our group made an application for being able to read text using your eye as the main interaction tool.
# To Use:
###### 1) Download the zipped source code of this project from this page
###### 2) Unzip it in your local folder of choice
###### 3) Install Python 3.10.4 from https://www.python.org/downloads/ . This application will NOT run without this or later version of python. While installing, make sure to add Python to PATH OR add it after installation
###### 4) Open the command line
###### 5) Type *pip install flask* into the command line. If you get an error Python has NOT been added to your PATH correctly. Please consult a website such as https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/ or similar for help
###### 6) Navigate to the directory where the unzipped contents are
###### 7) Type *python main.py*
###### 8) Copy the *http://127.0.0.1:5000/* address into your browser of choice. Works best on Google Chrome. Not working on Safari at the moment.
###### 9) Import a chosen .txt or .epub file. Two example files are provided
###### 10) Follow the calibration instructions for eye tracking to work
###### 11a) If a .txt file was uploaded, please use your MOUSE to change the settings to what is most comfortable for you to use. Look up to scroll up on the text file, and look down to scroll down
###### 11b) If a .epub file was uploaded, enjoy reading; currently the view settings only work with .txt files. Look at the *Prev* and *Next* buttons to navigate pages and look up to scroll up on the text file, and look down to scroll down
